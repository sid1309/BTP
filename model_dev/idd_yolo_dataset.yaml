# --- Path to the root dataset directory ---
# This directory should contain the 'images' and 'labels' folders
path: /home/admin/Documents/BTP/dataset  # Use absolute path - VERIFY THIS

# --- Paths to train/val/test image directories (relative to 'path') ---
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test  # Optional: Path to test images

# --- NOTE ---
# No need for train_txt, val_txt, test_txt as images are in separate folders.
# No need for the 'labels:' key, YOLOv5 automatically finds labels
# in ../labels/train, ../labels/val, etc., relative to the image folders.
